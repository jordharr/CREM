# CREM - Comms Room Environment Monitor

#### Student Name: *Jordan Harrison*   Student ID: *20095397*

CREM, or Comms Room Environment Monitor, is an experimental application to be hosted on a Raspberry Pi and used to monitor, log and alert temperature & humidity changes in one or multiple comms rooms. I propose to build a web interface with a login system used to view historical data and add sensors.

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

My proposal for tools, technologies and equipment for this project is as follows:

#### Tools

- Visual Studio Code

#### Technologies

- NodeJS
- [node-dht-sensor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-dht-sensor)
- Express
- Handlebars
- JSON files for storage of sensor data

#### Equipment

- Raspberry Pi 4 4GB
- Adafruit AM2302 DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensors
